    "    - We can in fact add qubits to the circuit at runtime using add_bits() method on the circuit we wish to add bits on. Super usefull for dynamically allocating data during the game\n",

    "\n",
    "    - We may quickly run into issues based quantum circuit similators limitations \n",
    "    - What elements of the circuit we can change and what values we can use at runtime will be major issue for implementation\n",
